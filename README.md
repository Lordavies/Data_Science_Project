# Data_Science_Project
The goal of this project is to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. In this assignment, I scaped a wikipedia page to obtain the tabulated data for Toronto, and transformed the data into a pandas dataframe. Also, I used the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto. I used the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I used the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, I used the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto and their emerging clusters.
